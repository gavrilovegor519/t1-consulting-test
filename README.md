## Problem

Design (think about the format and restrictions of incoming/outgoing parameters) and implement a REST API that calculates the frequency of occurrence of characters for a given string. The result should be sorted in descending order of the number of occurrences of the character in the given string.

Example input string: “aaaaabcccc”

Example output result: “a”: 5, “c”: 4, “b”: 1

## Run

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`
